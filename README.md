# CalculatorGui
## **Description**
I built this project as a practice exercise following a YouTube tutorial. It is a simple GUI-based calculator application built in Java using the Swing framework. It supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application features a graphical user interface with buttons for numbers, operators, decimal point, clear, delete, and negation functionality.
## **Features and Technologies Used**
The calculator includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal support, delete last entry, clear input field, and number negation. It is built using Java and utilizes the Swing framework for GUI components such as JFrame, JTextField, JButton, and JPanel, as well as AWT for font management, layout handling with GridLayout, and event handling with ActionListener.
## **What I Learned**
Building this calculator i practiced how to create a GUI in Java using Swing, manage user input and event-driven programming with ActionListener, and work with buttons, text fields, and layouts like JPanel and GridLayout. I also learned how to implement arithmetic operations, update the display dynamically, and handle functions like number negation and deletion. Additionally, I encountered and resolved common debugging issues such as incorrect parsing and event handling.
## **Possible Improvements**
One issue to fix is the decimal point handling, as it currently uses , instead of .. The UI could be improved with better styling for a more modern look. Adding keyboard input support would enhance usability. Implementing memory functions like MC, MR, M+, and M- would provide more functionality. Lastly, improving error handling for cases like division by zero would make the calculator more robust.
